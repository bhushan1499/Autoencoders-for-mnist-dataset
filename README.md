# Autoencoders-for-mnist-dataset
Build an autoencoder for compressing the dimensions of the images with the help of mnist dataset.The orignal dimension of the images in the mninst dataset was of 784(28,28,1) dimension.I have reduced the size to 25 dimensions and also removed the noise that was added to the datasets .
